![Bridge](/images/ep2-deck-plan.png)

All the senior officers were on the bridge, Captain Henry was in the command chair with Commander Dorsu Reson to his right and Lieutenant Commander Ezri Dax to his left, Okel was at tactical, Doldar at science, Sovin was sitting at engineering, with Lt Ziara at the helm and Ensign Buchanan at Ops.

Euan turned around "Captain we are cleared to depart the station"

Captain Hercules Henry felt like he should say something momentous. “I am inspired to quote the simple statement of an ancient children’s book author about those who dare to take adventures. It was Dr. Seuss who said, ‘Oh the places you’ll go.’” The captain settled into his chair and ordered, “Helm, let’s move out!”

"Helm plot course for the wormhole, three quarter impulse" the commander said.

Ziara wasn't sure how to react to that command for a moment, but the commander thankfully stepped in. "Plotting course for the wormhole, three quarter impulse. Aye Aye." Ziara said as the massive ship undocked from Deep Space Nine and headed towards the wormhole. The ship gracefully banked around the station, giving the crew and the people watching on the promenade a good view of the departure. The ship majestically slid through space towards the wormhole and a textbook perfect passage into the wormhole.

"Helm I want you to take a course that keeps us outside of Dominion and Rhilian space past the H'urq Outpost. Warp factor 9.25." The captain stood. "Commander, you have the bridge. I am going to inspect the ship and get my quarters in order."

"Aye captain" as the captain left, the commander moved into the captain's chair.

"Warp Factor 9.25, Aye Aye." Ziara had taken some time to plot the course using the maps available to them. She double checked to make sure they were in the right place using the references available to her. She smoothly brought the ship up to speed, taking care so that the acceleration wouldn't hurt the ship.

Okel keys a communication channel to security. “Security this is an intruder alert drill. There is a picture of a Terran rabbit in one of the ships corridors. Find it.” Okel starts a timer.

The commander smiled at Okel's comment "A Terran Rabbit"

Ensign Euan Buchanan turned around "A Terran rabbit sir" he said to Okel.

"It's a good choice. They are fun to hunt, taste good too." Ziara commented.

Ezri stood "Commander if you will excuse me".

The commander nodded at Ezri

After Ezri had walked into the turbo lift, Dorsu looked at the ship's senior helmsmen "Ziara, I understand that you have your own personal shuttle in the shuttlebay"

"Yes Ma'am, Black Betty, she’s my baby, I won the Five Sabres flying her." Ziara said, perking up, she loved to talk about her shuttle.
Dorsu smiled "I was a helmsman by training, if I could I would love to see her at some point"

"If I'm off shift and not sleeping, I'm probably working on her. So you can drop by. We'll have to wait until we get where we're going to take her for a spin. But I did the Denorious Dash right before I arrived and clocked a really good time." Ziara said happily.

"Well Ziara, i have a proposition for you" she smiled again at Ziara "I just got a holodeck program of the Delta Orbital Circuit, if your interested i'm looking for a co-pilot".

Okel looks at the timer counting the security drill.

"Sure, I might even bring a friend of mine along, Arlin, he's worked on Betty before." Ziara mentioned casually.

"Sounds great" the commander said.

Okel heard a chirp "Lieutenant Tonjot Zettu to Lieutenant Okel"

“Yes Zettu?” Okel responds.

"Can you run an internal scan of the ship to find this Terran rabbit" Zettu said

“Zettu, we are going into the Gamma Quadrant, where Jem’Hadar operate and they have been known to have personal shrouds that mask sensors. I suggest you treat this exercise as something similar. “

"So sir, what do you suggest we do" Zettu responded.

“I suggest you split the men. Assign half to vital areas that would need to be protected from hostile intruders. The other half should split into two-man crews. Have the ones covering vital areas check hallways in route? Have the other crew check the other hallways. Work the ship like a giant piece of chocolate layered cake.

About five minutes later Zettu called up "Sir Rabbit has been located outside engineering, drill complete"

“Very good Zettu. Let’s meet in stargazer after shift.” Okel keys off the comm. ‘Five minutes is a long time.’ He thinks to himself.
Euan turned around "So Doldar what made you join starfleet"

"Rule of acquisition number 6, never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity." Doldar chuckled. "Although I had initially rejected the philosophy of the Rules of Acquisition, I had adapted it to serve me. My father always pushed me to follow in his business instead of following my intellectual pursuits." Doldar sat back into his chair, thinking about which Human terminology to use. "I guess I am a black sheep, as the Humans say." said Doldar with a smile.

"You'll always be a white sheep to me." Ziara replied playfully.

“One should not always be guided by family, but by what is inside the person.” Okel tilted his head. “Maybe that came out wrong. I don’t mean to imply there is something other than you living inside of you.”

Doldar attempted an awkward wink at Ziara.

Ziara silently laughed in response to Doldar's wink. "I didn't hear it that way. Though the Commander might know about having something living in them." She said in reply to Okel.

Okel’s antennae snapped up. His face turned a deeper blue colour. “Uh...”

After a few hours the crew's shift ended "Well that's the shift over" the commander said as the captain came out and took the bridge.
While in the turbo lift, Dorsu turned to Ziara "I was about to try out that holodeck program if you are interested"
"Sure! Let's go!" Ziara said enthusiastically.

"Okay, you and Arlin meet me there in an hour" she began to walk out of the turbo lift "Oh, and bring the schematics of that shuttle of yours, we can program her in and use her"
