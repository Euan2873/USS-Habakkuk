#### Prologue
<br />
![Bridge](/images/ep2-deck-plan.png)

All the senior officers were on the bridge, Captain Henry was in the command chair with Commander Dorsu Reson to his right and Lieutenant Commander Ezri Dax to his left, Okel was at tactical, Doldar at science, Sovin was sitting at engineering, with Lt Ziara at the helm and Ensign Buchanan at Ops.

Euan turned around "Captain we are cleared to depart the station"

Captain Hercules Henry felt like he should say something momentous. “I am inspired to quote the simple statement of an ancient children’s book author about those who dare to take adventures. It was Dr. Seuss who said, ‘Oh the places you’ll go.’” The captain settled into his chair and ordered, “Helm, let’s move out!”

"Helm plot course for the wormhole, three quarter impulse" the commander said.

Ziara wasn't sure how to react to that command for a moment, but the commander thankfully stepped in. "Plotting course for the wormhole, three quarter impulse. Aye Aye." Ziara said as the massive ship undocked from Deep Space Nine and headed towards the wormhole. The ship gracefully banked around the station, giving the crew and the people watching on the promenade a good view of the departure. The ship majestically slid through space towards the wormhole and a textbook perfect passage into the wormhole.

"Helm I want you to take a course that keeps us outside of Dominion and Rhilian space past the H'urq Outpost. Warp factor 9.25." The captain stood. "Commander, you have the bridge. I am going to inspect the ship and get my quarters in order."

"Aye captain" as the captain left, the commander moved into the captain's chair.

"Warp Factor 9.25, Aye Aye." Ziara had taken some time to plot the course using the maps available to them. She double checked to make sure they were in the right place using the references available to her. She smoothly brought the ship up to speed, taking care so that the acceleration wouldn't hurt the ship.

Okel keys a communication channel to security. “Security this is an intruder alert drill. There is a picture of a Terran rabbit in one of the ships corridors. Find it.” Okel starts a timer.

The commander smiled at Okel's comment "A Terran Rabbit"

Ensign Euan Buchanan turned around "A Terran rabbit sir" he said to Okel.

"It's a good choice. They are fun to hunt, taste good too." Ziara commented.

Ezri stood "Commander if you will excuse me".

The commander nodded at Ezri

After Ezri had walked into the turbo lift, Dorsu looked at the ship's senior helmsmen "Ziara, I understand that you have your own personal shuttle in the shuttlebay"

"Yes Ma'am, Black Betty, she’s my baby, I won the Five Sabres flying her." Ziara said, perking up, she loved to talk about her shuttle.
Dorsu smiled "I was a helmsman by training, if I could I would love to see her at some point"

"If I'm off shift and not sleeping, I'm probably working on her. So you can drop by. We'll have to wait until we get where we're going to take her for a spin. But I did the Denorious Dash right before I arrived and clocked a really good time." Ziara said happily.

"Well Ziara, i have a proposition for you" she smiled again at Ziara "I just got a holodeck program of the Delta Orbital Circuit, if your interested i'm looking for a co-pilot".

Okel looks at the timer counting the security drill.

"Sure, I might even bring a friend of mine along, Arlin, he's worked on Betty before." Ziara mentioned casually.

"Sounds great" the commander said.

Okel heard a chirp "Lieutenant Tonjot Zettu to Lieutenant Okel"

“Yes Zettu?” Okel responds.

"Can you run an internal scan of the ship to find this Terran rabbit" Zettu said

“Zettu, we are going into the Gamma Quadrant, where Jem’Hadar operate and they have been known to have personal shrouds that mask sensors. I suggest you treat this exercise as something similar. “

"So sir, what do you suggest we do" Zettu responded.

“I suggest you split the men. Assign half to vital areas that would need to be protected from hostile intruders. The other half should split into two-man crews. Have the ones covering vital areas check hallways in route? Have the other crew check the other hallways. Work the ship like a giant piece of chocolate layered cake.

About five minutes later Zettu called up "Sir Rabbit has been located outside engineering, drill complete"

“Very good Zettu. Let’s meet in stargazer after shift.” Okel keys off the comm. ‘Five minutes is a long time.’ He thinks to himself.
Euan turned around "So Doldar what made you join starfleet"

"Rule of acquisition number 6, never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity." Doldar chuckled. "Although I had initially rejected the philosophy of the Rules of Acquisition, I had adapted it to serve me. My father always pushed me to follow in his business instead of following my intellectual pursuits." Doldar sat back into his chair, thinking about which Human terminology to use. "I guess I am a black sheep, as the Humans say." said Doldar with a smile.

"You'll always be a white sheep to me." Ziara replied playfully.

“One should not always be guided by family, but by what is inside the person.” Okel tilted his head. “Maybe that came out wrong. I don’t mean to imply there is something other than you living inside of you.”

Doldar attempted an awkward wink at Ziara.

Ziara silently laughed in response to Doldar's wink. "I didn't hear it that way. Though the Commander might know about having something living in them." She said in reply to Okel.

Okel’s antennae snapped up. His face turned a deeper blue colour. “Uh...”

After a few hours the crew's shift ended "Well that's the shift over" the commander said as the captain came out and took the bridge.
While in the turbo lift, Dorsu turned to Ziara "I was about to try out that holodeck program if you are interested"
"Sure! Let's go!" Ziara said enthusiastically.

"Okay, you and Arlin meet me there in an hour" she began to walk out of the turbo lift "Oh, and bring the schematics of that shuttle of yours, we can program her in and use her"

#### Chapter 1

After shift Okel goes to the ships pub. “Hello Tonjot.” Okel sits down. “Looks like the Habakkuk had a lot of personnel change at DS9. I’d like your thoughts on personnel and what we should be prepared to face.”

Okel continues, “Since we are going to be out here on our own, I think we need to review every kind of security problem that has come up on ships in the last 10 years and have some sort of plan in place. It’s going to mean a lot of drills and a lot of training on the holodeck.”

Tonjot took a sip of his drink "Okay sir, sounds like a good idea"

Okel nods “Do you have any famous ships you’d like to review?”

"Well there was the USS Defiant, they have had experience in the gamma quadrant which could be beneficial" Tonjot said

“Very good,” Okel said. “How about you dig into that. Tomorrow we can meet at some time and review staff.” Okel excuses himself and heads to his room.

#### Chapter 2

![Holodeck](/images/holodeck.jpg)

Dorsu was standing outside holodeck two waiting on Ziara and Arlin. She tapped some buttons on the console "Computer activate program Reson-Gamma-Six"

A few seconds later the computer said, "Program active, enter when ready"

Ziara showed up practically bouncing off the walls. She handed Dorsu an information stick. "I went aheard and updated her stats with her current configuration as well as the configuration she had four years ago, just in case." She enthused.

"Great" Dorsu said "Computer update program to use shuttle specifications just entered"

"Program updated" the computer said

Ziara bounded into the holodeck which was simulating the station that overlooked Nardau VII, a class D planet, where the Delta Orbital Circuit took place. "Just like I remember it!" She enthused. Standing before them was a sleek black runabout sized craft. "Come on, I'll show you around." Ziara said moving quickly towards the shuttle.

Dorsu walked into the holodeck and then onto the shuttle "So the grand tour then"

Ziara almost seemed to dance onto the shuttle. "Ok, this area here is the cargo compartment. It's a lot cleaner then it is in real life, because I'm carrying spare parts, trade goods, and the like. It's the perfect size for a courier. I even imported exactly how the wires are currently laid out on the Betty." She pulled back one of the panels to show her wiring. While it was neat and clean, it was very clearly hand placed, indicating that the simulation was incredibly close to the actual Black Betty.

Chell walked into the holodeck and headed the simulated shuttle. With a knock on the open shuttle door Chell spoke up, "Hello hello. Seems holo-Betty is a lot cleaner. Still has the scratches though."

"I just had the internal sensors do a new sweep. So, it should be identical in every way to the one down in shuttle bay, except for the cargo and stuff." Ziara explained as she welcomed Chell into the small cargo bay.

When Chell spotted Dorsu they stood at attention out of reflex. "Sir. I didn't realize you'd be here."

"At ease and who's idea did you think this was"

Chell relaxed before looking toward Ziara. "Well I was told we might try Betty out in the holodeck sir. Not much more."

Ziara gave a wide grin and rubbed the back of her head with her hand, "Sorry." Ziara said before moving into the next room. "Anyway, next is the crew cabin. It's small, but enough for two." She said, the room was small, with two bunks, a small table, and a large industrial replicator. A small replica of the Black Betty hung from the ceiling. "Part of the reason that it's so small is that we have a lot of extra power packed into her." Ziara explained, removing a panel to show the extra generation capability.

"Okay then, where is my seat" Dosru said to Ziara.

Ziara continued forward to the cockpit. As she passed the model shuttle, she touched it and said something in Caitian. Unlike most, it was thinner, the consoles being arranged front and back rather than side by side. Ziara slid into the front seat easily, it was clearly made for her small size. "Here is where we fly from. Typically, the front is configured for the pilot and the back for the engineer. I installed some heavy-duty springs in the joysticks so that you get that extra little bit of precision. If necessary, I can control the whole ship from the pilot seat, but it's a lot more hectic." Ziara explained.

"Alrighty" Dosru said "If you are piloting and Arlin will be doing engineering, where do you want me"

"Betty's designed for at most two people. Honestly, one person who knows what they’re doing. The auto-pilot is smart too. There's a small console in the back, but it's mostly meant for testing and such. Arlin knows what the Betty can do, so I'm going to put him back there. You don't, so you get the backseat. The default layout is all standard, but you can configure your preferences if you want. It's mostly meant for an engineer, but you can fly from there too. The front seat is mine, and... well it's kind of customized and not nearly as flexible." Ziara said motioning to the joysticks which were fixed in place. If the pilot was Ziara sized, it would be perfect. For those who weren't tiny little runts like the Caitian pilot, it would be at best cramped and uncomfortable.

Chell laughed and spoke up. "Trust her there. Tried to fly once from the pilot’s seat. Nearly rammed into the station hanger."

Just then the group heard a chirp "Commander Reson report to the bridge"

Dosru sighed "Acknowledged, sorry i guess it’s up to you" she began to exit the shuttle "Computer arch". The arch appeared and she walked out "I'll try and catch up"

Ziara nodded, "All right," then after the Commander left, she said to Chell, "Let's get a feel for the track." She suggested.

Chell's eyes widened a bit. They grabbed hold of the console and planted feet fire. "Ok then.

Ziara grinned at Chell's reaction and settled into the pilot's seat. "Well with her gone, at least you get a chance to strap in." She said as the ship took off

Chell moved to strap in as quickly as possible. Once secured Chell looked at the shuttle's readouts. "Seems Holo-Betty is just like the real thing."

A voice came over the intercom in the shuttle "You are cleared to depart" the voice said as the shuttle began to exit station.

Ziara pulled the ship out of the shuttle bay. "So, we start here. There is a quick loop around the sun." Ziara said, firing up the engines, but not at maximum, and the ship hurtled towards the Star. They were just looking at the course rather than running it seriously. Ziara swung them around the sun and continued to the nebula. "Then we get a nice pea soup to fly through. Do you think we could calibrate the sensors for it?" She asked Chell as they passed through the nebula. "Then we run down and along this asteroid field, a bit thick, but nothing too difficult." She said, watching how the rocks moved in the asteroid field.

Chell held on tight, not sure if Ziara might gun it. Getting a quick glance at the nebula they chuckled a bit. "Sensors will be a bit of an issue in that...soup. Sure, we'll handle it though."
