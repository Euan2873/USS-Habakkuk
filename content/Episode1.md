Hercules Henry, the new Starfleet captain about to get given his commission stood looking along the promenade, Deep Space Nine was one of the most historical sites in federation history. The site where the dominion first attacked, where the Cardassians occupied Bajor and the site where the emissary used to be stationed. 

This was his first time on DS9 and he was really excited, he stood and saw a trill with the science’s uniform and the Pips of a lieutenant commander ran over to him, “You must be captain Henry, it is a pleasure to meet you sir” she said with a smile on her face “I am Lieutenant commander Ezri dax, welcome to Deep Space Nine, General Kira is waiting on the operations deck” she motioned for him to walk with her “She is waiting with details about your ship”

“Wonderful. Such a pleasure to meet you, Dax. So, you have an interesting history, or should I say herstory, I have heard.”
Hercules paused. “I am a student of etiquette. What is the best way to address a joined Trill with a diverse background?”
"Please sir, just call me Ezri" she said as they walked towards the elevator next to Quark's bar.

"Not at all, I am the nineth host of the dax symbiote" she responded "So how did you get your promotion, if I may ask" she said smiling
Hercules tone went dry. 

“My former position was as an XO on a strategic and defense patrol vessel in the Gamma Quadrant. We were hunting down some Genzemi weapons dealers who had weaponized a virulent flowering weed. We were ambushed when they transported the blooming weeds aboard ship. We were barely able to contain the spread of the pollen before it took out half the crew, including the captain. I had to take command. We halted the toxin and I worked with the doctor to concoct a cure to treat the rest of us who were effected.” Hercules looked at Ezri. “Then we hunted down the Genzemi responsible and captured them.”

Ezri's smile left her face, she was expecting something about him being a model officer "Well i am sure you can cope with whatever is thrown at you" she said as she entered the lift. 

As they entered Ezri spoke out "Ops" and as the lift left, they could hear someone shout "Quark"

“Who is Quark?” 

"It's a long story" Ezri responded. This had put the smile back on her face
The lift arrived in ops and Hercules and Ezri both walked off, they heard shouting coming from the office "I told you i needed the report from the defient repairs on my desk" she yelled "Dismissed" the doors opened and two men in starfleet operations uniforms walked out.

Hercules looked at Ezri. "Bad time?"

"That is general Kira, she has your comission"

Hercules had heard of the Bajoran officer by reputation. She was purportedly quite the fireball. Now, he would see for himself. 
Both officers walked up to the office and the door opened "General, captain Henry is here to see you" 

"Thank you Zi, dismissed" Kira responded

"General," Hercules said once Ezri exited.

"Take a seat captain" Kira said as she motioned for him to sitdown. "First of all, welcome to Deep space Nine" I the officer there was seats and the desk with a console on it as well as a dirty, old baseball. She held a Padd and pressed some buttons on it "Well i have your ship, USS Habakkuk"

"I am delighted, as you can well imagine." Hercules eyed the baseball. "Pardon me, General. You play baseball?"
"No, it was the stations old captain"

A chirp came over the comm "Brig to Admiral Kira, we have an Arlin Chell"

"On my way, well captain are you ready to meet your chief engineer" she said

"Of course," Hercules said as he stood. "Then, I suppose, I can sign the lease and you can give me the keys.

"I suppose so" she said as she began to walk out of the room.

Hercules laughed at his own joke and followed the general.

The captain and General walked into the brig to see some sort of Bolian/Bajoran hybrid species. "Captain Hercules Henry, meet Arlin Chell, your new chief engineer" Hercules looked around. 

"We are in the brig. Why? Why is my new chief engineer in the brig?"

"I will let him explain that one" she smiled "The Habakkuk is in docking port three" she walked out of the room.
Chell turned over on the bed in the brig. As he got a look at the Captain standing outside, he rolled off onto the floor before scrambling to attention. "Captain." He waited for a response.

“Explain yourself, crewman.”

"Well sir I had a bit of a disagreement with a fellow I met at the bar here." Chell rubbed his jaw a bit. "That ended up getting a bit physical. Should be happy his friends were there to back him up." 

"A fight? What are you? Fresh out of the Academy? Is this normal for you?"
 
"No sir. Only happened because they said Starfleet was a joke. They can mock me all they want, but they can't mock the uniform."

"Hm. I prefer a more polite approach." Hercules surveyed the brig that held Chell. "So, she didn't quite leave directions for how to get you out of here. Let's see how much weight my command codes carry on a Bajoran station." The captain tapped a standard command code into the console next to the brig.

The force field lowered and Arlin walked out towards the captain.

"I think we should get you off this station and onto the Habakkuk before any other incidents, Chief. What do you say?"
"Aye, sir."
