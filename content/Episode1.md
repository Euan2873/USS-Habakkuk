Hercules Henry, the new Starfleet captain about to get given his commission stood looking along the promenade, Deep Space Nine was one of the most historical sites in federation history. The site where the dominion first attacked, where the Cardassians occupied Bajor and the site where the emissary used to be stationed. 

This was his first time on DS9 and he was really excited, he stood and saw a trill with the science’s uniform and the Pips of a lieutenant commander ran over to him, “You must be captain Henry, it is a pleasure to meet you sir” she said with a smile on her face “I am Lieutenant commander Ezri dax, welcome to Deep Space Nine, General Kira is waiting on the operations deck” she motioned for him to walk with her “She is waiting with details about your ship”

“Wonderful. Such a pleasure to meet you, Dax. So, you have an interesting history, or should I say herstory, I have heard.”
Hercules paused. “I am a student of etiquette. What is the best way to address a joined Trill with a diverse background?”
"Please sir, just call me Ezri" she said as they walked towards the elevator next to Quark's bar.

"Not at all, I am the nineth host of the dax symbiote" she responded "So how did you get your promotion, if I may ask" she said smiling
Hercules tone went dry. 

“My former position was as an XO on a strategic and defense patrol vessel in the Gamma Quadrant. We were hunting down some Genzemi weapons dealers who had weaponized a virulent flowering weed. We were ambushed when they transported the blooming weeds aboard ship. We were barely able to contain the spread of the pollen before it took out half the crew, including the captain. I had to take command. We halted the toxin and I worked with the doctor to concoct a cure to treat the rest of us who were effected.” Hercules looked at Ezri. “Then we hunted down the Genzemi responsible and captured them.”

Ezri's smile left her face, she was expecting something about him being a model officer "Well i am sure you can cope with whatever is thrown at you" she said as she entered the lift. 

As they entered Ezri spoke out "Ops" and as the lift left, they could hear someone shout "Quark"

“Who is Quark?” 

"It's a long story" Ezri responded. This had put the smile back on her face
The lift arrived in ops and Hercules and Ezri both walked off, they heard shouting coming from the office "I told you i needed the report from the defient repairs on my desk" she yelled "Dismissed" the doors opened and two men in starfleet operations uniforms walked out.

Hercules looked at Ezri. "Bad time?"

"That is general Kira, she has your comission"

Hercules had heard of the Bajoran officer by reputation. She was purportedly quite the fireball. Now, he would see for himself. 
Both officers walked up to the office and the door opened "General, captain Henry is here to see you" 

"Thank you Zi, dismissed" Kira responded

"General," Hercules said once Ezri exited.

"Take a seat captain" Kira said as she motioned for him to sitdown. "First of all, welcome to Deep space Nine" I the officer there was seats and the desk with a console on it as well as a dirty, old baseball. She held a Padd and pressed some buttons on it "Well i have your ship, USS Habakkuk"

"I am delighted, as you can well imagine." Hercules eyed the baseball. "Pardon me, General. You play baseball?"
"No, it was the stations old captain"

A chirp came over the comm "Brig to Admiral Kira, we have an Arlin Chell"

"On my way, well captain are you ready to meet your chief engineer" she said

"Of course," Hercules said as he stood. "Then, I suppose, I can sign the lease and you can give me the keys.

"I suppose so" she said as she began to walk out of the room.

Hercules laughed at his own joke and followed the general.

The captain and General walked into the brig to see some sort of Bolian/Bajoran hybrid species. "Captain Hercules Henry, meet Arlin Chell, your new chief engineer" Hercules looked around. 

"We are in the brig. Why? Why is my new chief engineer in the brig?"

"I will let him explain that one" she smiled "The Habakkuk is in docking port three" she walked out of the room.
Chell turned over on the bed in the brig. As he got a look at the Captain standing outside, he rolled off onto the floor before scrambling to attention. "Captain." He waited for a response.

“Explain yourself, crewman.”

"Well sir I had a bit of a disagreement with a fellow I met at the bar here." Chell rubbed his jaw a bit. "That ended up getting a bit physical. Should be happy his friends were there to back him up." 

"A fight? What are you? Fresh out of the Academy? Is this normal for you?"
 
"No sir. Only happened because they said Starfleet was a joke. They can mock me all they want, but they can't mock the uniform."

"Hm. I prefer a more polite approach." Hercules surveyed the brig that held Chell. "So, she didn't quite leave directions for how to get you out of here. Let's see how much weight my command codes carry on a Bajoran station." The captain tapped a standard command code into the console next to the brig.

The force field lowered and Arlin walked out towards the captain.

"I think we should get you off this station and onto the Habakkuk before any other incidents, Chief. What do you say?"
"Aye, sir."

![Bridge](/assets/images/Bridge.jpg)

Captain Henry and Chief Petty Officer Chell walked onto the bridge of the new galaxy class refit, the USS Habakkuk. They could see all of their senior staff on the bridge at their stations, the first officer, Commander Feezal a denobulan female was sitting in the captain's chair. "Make sure the EPS grid is calibrated correctly" .At ops was ensign Buchanan, this was his first posting "Yes sir". The commander turned around to look at tactical and saw the captain and shot out of her seat "Captain on the bridge" she said and every officer on the bridge stood at attention.

Ziara bolted out of her chair, her salute crisp and precise. Her attention stance was perfect as was her uniform. She was used to formal settings from her time with Nova Squadron. The Caitian was short, standing only four foot nine inches high and was thin. She was short by Caitian standards and had been the runt of her litter. Her black stripes on white fur made her resemble a white tiger. She cut her hair short in what was, for a Caitian, a very boyish way. She smiled ever so slightly at finally meeting her new captain.

Lieutenant Th'akyllith looked up from tactical. He snaps to attention eyes on the Captain. His antenna twitch and the CPO Chell's nonchalant attitude. 'Ziara' He thinks. 'I seem to remember that name from the past. I wonder if it is a common name for a Caitian.' His eyes never waver from the captain.

“At ease.” The captain sat in his chair. “Ops. Status report?”

Ziara sqeed inside, and soon as the Captain said 'at ease' she relaxed enough to let the look of happiness at seeing one of her best friends cross her face. She gave Arlin a wink and a small wave as she sat back down. If she didn't have a report to give in a few moments, she would have dashed over and gave Arlin a flying bear hug.

"DS9 has given us clearance to depart sir" Euan turned around "The warp plasma manifold is out of alignment by point zero five microns, but we can repair that on route"

“I would hope so. Well, crew, we can get to know each other better once we get going. Helm detach all morning clamps. Move us away from the station at one-eighth impulse.”

"Aye, detaching all mooring clamps. Moving us away from the station at one-eighth impulse." Ziara replied crisply. While she liked the accent personally, unlike many Caitian's she preferred her translators not use a purring 'accent' with her speech while on duty. Off duty, well she thought it was sexy, but not appropriate for work when you needed clarity.

Ensign Buchanan pressed some buttons on his console "captain, orders have come through" he tapped a few more buttons "we are to head for Trillious prime on a simple shakedown cruise, once there we will receive orders by the Deep space nine and starfleet command"

“Very good. Helm let’s move out! Warp factor 5.”

Just as the captain said that, the entire bridge went red as the ship rocked. Euan fell out of chair, and the rest of the senior staff rocked and fell over.

"Report!"

The ops ensign stood and sat back in his chair "No damage captain, i don't think it hit us,", he tapped his console "from what I can tell they hit the station, we are being hailed by the general sir"

Ziara stayed in her chair as the ship rocked, "Manuvering to safe distance." Ziara reported.

“Hit the station?” Okel thinks. He raises shields and checks tactical readouts to see if enemies are near.

“Tactical, Shields up and scan the area. Who fired? What kind of weapon? How much damage did they do?” Hercules got back into his chair. “Hail DS9!”

"Shields up sir." Okel began to scan the area. "Scanning sir"

 “Sir 3 Galor class warships are attacking the station. We were apparently caught in the crossfire and may not be the primary target.” Okel pauses and quietly says “They are sloppy with targeting. “
 
 “We have to assist,” the captain said. “Lt Rrareth, attack pattern Omega Five. USS Habakkuk to Deep Space Nine, do you need assistance?” Hercules asked over an open Hail
 
"Attack pattern Omega Five, Aye Aye." Ziara called out as the huge ship suddenly changed course, flipping over Deep Space Nine with an irreverent defiance of standard starship maneuvers. Under her touch the ship moved like a ballet dancer as it hurled back between the arms of Deep Space Nine towards the attacking Galors. She also took a moment to respond to the hail, "Deep Space Nine on screen." She reported as the general appeared.

"Captain" the general said, she was covered in grease and the room had flames coming off the consoles. "We were attacked, we have lost upper pylon two and they have damaged our weapons systems, they are escaping through the wormhole, you can still track them." A crewman shouted from the background "They have taken the orb of contemplation" The general looked at the captain "Go get our orb back, i will have the defiant follow as soon as possible"

Hercules heard the order. One side of him wanted to aid the station. But he knew what the orbs meant to the Bajoran people. The orbs were how their prophets communicated with them. They were religious artefacts of the utmost importance. “Helm break off our attack. Plot a course for the wormhole. Mr. Doldar, track and lock onto the ship that had the orb. Scan its engine signature before they hit the wormhole, so we don’t lose them on the other side.” The other side. Captain Henry felt a wave of excitement go through his torso; they were about to enter the Gamma Quadrant.

The general disappeared of screen as the bridge got a call from engineering. "Engineering to bridge, that hit damaged an EPS conduit that links the sensors to the science console, sensors will be unreliable at best"

Chell shrugged his head. "I step on board and then something needs fixing"

Lt. Daphina, a Denobulan science officer was at the sensor station and attempted a scan to find the source of the attack, the results yielded nothing. She reported, "Sir,sensors are having difficulty pin-pointing the source of the attack."

"Breaking off the attack and plotting a course for the wormhole, Aye Aye" Ziara said, her hands flying over the controls as she worked out the best options. She saw one of the options put them right behind the ship that had stolen the orb. The massive ship twisted onto its new course, "We are right on their tails, sir" she announced.
